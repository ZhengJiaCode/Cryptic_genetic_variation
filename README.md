# Cryptic_genetic_variation

These python scripts (Python 2.7.12) are used for SMRT sequencing data analysis in the manuscript titled 'Cryptic genetic variation accelerates evolution by opening access to diverse adaptive peaks'.

Please first install python 2.7.x on your computer.
An example for executing programs(via the terminal of ubuntu 16.04LTS system) below:

python 1_Mean_numberOfSNPs_cDNA.py v0_replicate1.txt

The file 'v0_replicate1.txt' (in fasta format) contains cDNA sequences of YFP individuals sequenced by SMRT in the population v0 replicate 1. Note that you may need specify the paths for '1_Mean_numberOfSNPs_cDNA.py' and 'v0_replicate1.txt' if they are not in the current directory.
